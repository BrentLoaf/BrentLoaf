## Yo! 👋

I'm Brent! a 19yo software developer, and I've been programming for the better part of 10 years

My current main focus is expanding my Java knowledge and maybe picking up a few skills on the way, e.g:
- ☐ Learn how to use SpringBoot and making a project with it
- ☐ Understand app development better and try to make a personal workout app with backend accounts
- ☐ Make my own portfolio site from the ground up by learning HTML and CSS
- ☐ Develop my own game in [Java](https://youtu.be/w79nuSSSF_8?t=43) with JMonkeyEngine (LOTTA IDEAS)

The tools I use are largely what I've developed on my own, espscially in Minecraft plugins:
- ItemLib: A library that makes custom items easier to make with little to no boiler plate
- PowerLib: Letting me easily set power conditions, cooldown messages and activations with a builder pattern
- AbilitiesLib: A more streamlined way of making custom powers, how they avtivate and in what order
All of these libs I've developed to hook into each other and ngl that was HELL to do
But compressing a few thousand lines of code per item with powers into sometimes less than hundrad was 100% worth it lol

If you wanna reach me at all, even just to ask a question I'm always accepting messages via emgail at `business.brentloaf@gmail.com`
