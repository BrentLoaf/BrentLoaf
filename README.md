## Yo! 👋

I'm Brent! a 19yo software developer, and I've been programming for the better part of 10 years


The tools I use are largely what I've developed on my own, especially in Minecraft plugins:

- ItemLib: A library that makes custom items easier to make with little to no boilerplate
  - In plugins, custom items are probably one of the most common ideas right next to minigames.
    This lib alone cut down on boilerplate at least 5-fold by making item definitions more readable and easier to edit in future versions.
  
- PowerLib: Letting me easily set power conditions, cooldowns, cooldown messages, and activations with a builder pattern
  - This was probably the most fun to develop, strangely enough. This was the real glue that held these systems together.
    Defining cooldowns, conditions, and custom mana systems was instantly easier with this surprisingly simple system I built.
  
- AbilitiesLib: A more streamlined way of making custom powers, how they activate, and in what order
  - Easily the most complex out of the three, and it shows why: defining something as creative as a power that could have virtually limitless possibilities.
    But again, instantly worth it, since it taught me a lot about designing ever-evolving systems and expandable/maintainable code without going overly abstract.

All of these libs I've developed are designed to hook into each other and depend on each other without circular dependency.
But compressing a few thousand lines of code per item with powers into sometimes less than a hundred was 100% worth it.



What I'm currently up to:

- ☐ Building a backend system using SpringBoot
- ☐ Developing a workout app with Flutter/Dart with a backend system to manage accounts and databases


For the future:

- ☐ Construct a Minecraft plugin that allows users to make their own currencies, exchange between them, and maybe even hook into it with a bot
  - Why a Minecraft plugin? Perfect community to test my systems in their own customized way, plus I'd get to learn more about economics
  
- ☐ Build my own portfolio site from the ground up by learning HTML and CSS
  - Why a portfolio site? It would be immediately helpful to me, rather than a throw-away project 
  
- ☐ Develop my own game in [Java](https://youtu.be/w79nuSSSF_8?t=43) with JMonkeyEngine
  - Why a game? I need to prove them wrong when they say Java sucks for games 🤞 Also, I have big ideas for it
