## Yo! 👋

I'm Brent! a 19yo software developer, and I've been programming for the better part of 10 years

My current main focus is expanding my Java knowledge and maybe picking up a few skills on the way, e.g:
- ☐ Learn how to use SpringBoot and making a project with it
- ☐ Understand app development better and try to make a personal workout app with backend accounts
- ☐ Make my own portfolio site from the ground up by learnign HTML and CSS
- ☐ Develop my own game in [Java](https://youtu.be/w79nuSSSF_8?t=43) with JMonkeyEngine
